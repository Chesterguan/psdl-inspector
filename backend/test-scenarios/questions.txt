Scenario 1 — IRB-Style Research Intent (Ambiguous but Real)

“We aim to study whether there are identifiable clinical signals preceding an increase in acute kidney injury (AKI) risk among adult ICU patients.
The study population includes patients aged 18 or older with at least one ICU admission in the past three years.
Patients with pre-existing end-stage renal disease or chronic dialysis should be excluded.
The primary observation window is the first 72 hours following ICU admission.”

Why this matters

This is how IRB protocols are actually written

Definitions are intentionally incomplete at this stage

The intent must be preserved even as definitions evolve

PSDL signal
→ Captures research intent before operationalization
→ Supports versioning as AKI definitions or ICU criteria change

Scenario 2 — Model Evaluation & Regression Testing

“We want to evaluate whether the performance of the updated AKI prediction model has changed compared to the previous version across specific patient subgroups.
The evaluation should focus on ICU patients who:
(1) have a documented history of diabetes,
(2) received vasoactive medications within 24 hours of ICU admission, or
(3) underwent contrast imaging within 48 hours prior to ICU admission.
Model performance will be compared using AUROC and calibration metrics.”

Why this matters

Subgroup definitions are often informal and undocumented

Model comparisons become irreproducible over time

PSDL signal
→ Encodes evaluation logic as a first-class artifact
→ Makes subgroup definitions auditable and reusable

Scenario 3 — Temporal & Causal Clinical Pattern

“We are interested in patients who received broad-spectrum antibiotics during hospitalization,
subsequently developed leukopenia within seven days,
and were transferred to the ICU within 48 hours after leukopenia onset.
The goal is to assess whether there exists a clinically actionable intervention window prior to ICU transfer.”

Why this matters

Time order is critical

Traditional cohort queries are fragile and opaque

PSDL signal
→ Explicit temporal sequencing
→ Clear state transitions rather than implicit SQL logic

Scenario 4 — Multi-Institution Study Without Data Sharing

“Multiple institutions will apply the same research scenario locally to their own clinical data.
The objective is to compare ICU medication utilization patterns across sites without sharing patient-level data.
Each institution may map local data elements to the scenario using equivalent definitions where necessary, while preserving the core scenario logic.”

Why this matters

Protocols are shared, but semantics drift across sites

Reproducibility is often assumed, not verified

PSDL signal
→ Shares semantic intent instead of data
→ Enables local mapping with global auditability

Scenario 5 — Synthetic Patient Scenarios for Education or Stress Testing

“We aim to construct a class of synthetic patient scenarios for educational and simulation purposes.
The scenario represents middle-aged or elderly patients admitted for infection,
who initially present with stable vital signs,
followed by gradual multi-organ dysfunction within 48 hours.
The scenarios should be clinically coherent but must not correspond to any real individual patient.”

Why this matters

Purely generative models lack clinical grounding

Education and safety testing require controlled realism

PSDL signal
→ Defines clinical plausibility constraints
→ Serves as guardrails for simulation or LLM-based generation
